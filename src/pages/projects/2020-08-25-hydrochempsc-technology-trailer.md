The HydroChemPSC Technology Trailer is an interactive mobile exhibit, that travels the country and showcases the company's latest services and technology through remotely updated touchscreen and physical interfaces.

## Challenge

The client was struggling to showcase their continually evolving service-lines and state-of-the-art technology to a broad customer base spread throughout the United States. Traditional marketing mediums were not impactful enough and typical trade show exhibits were not mobile. They needed a solution that would work throughout the year, where and when they needed it.
