  and state-of-the-art technology to a broad customer base spread throughout the
  United States. Traditional marketing mediums were not impactful enough and
  typical trade show exhibits were not mobile. They needed a solution that would
  work throughout the year, where and when they needed it.


  The content needed to frequently update so that they could keep their brand and message ahead of the competition. The ultimate goal was to inform, educate, and impress upon prospective customers the value of their services and advanced technology.
