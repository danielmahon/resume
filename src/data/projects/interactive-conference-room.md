description: The HydroChemPSC interactive conference room provides an atmosphere
  and the tools for staff, trainees, customers, and shareholders to get the most
  out of any typical meeting experience.
challenge: The challenge was to add cost-effective updates to a highly utilized
  conference room to provide a better atmosphere and more engaging experience.
solution: The solution was to design and produce cost-effective graphics and
  interactive content that could be applied to the existing architecture without
  intrusive changes. The final project definitely enhanced time spent in the
  room and encouraged further communication among visitors leading to more
  effective training and sales experiences.

challenges:
  - label: Create a cost-effective engaging environment
    content: >-
      Branding and wall graphics spruce up the "plain" architecture. A small
      museum-like section was added to contrast the old, outdated technology
      against the newer tech being showcased around the room and on the
      displays. During meetings, users are encouraged to explore the interactive
      panels and learn more about the services being discussed.
       
      Some technologies used:


      - 20", 50" multi-touch displays
        - Intel NUC Linux systems running dockerized os
        - Custom react-native applications
      - Interactive LED Map

      - Custom circuitry and electronics
  - label: Make content easy to update remotely
    content: >-
      Each interactive display application is connected to the internet via
      cellular modem and can be remotely updated by authorized users, via a
      web-based content management system built on ReactJS and NodeJS, running
      on Google Cloud. Changes are instant if the trailer has a good cellular
      connection. Offline updates are pulled down automatically after reconnect.
      All display applications are cached offline and work without an internet
      connection. System os and applications can also be remotely flashed and
      monitored via balenaCloud.


      Some technologies used:


      - ReactJS, React-Native, Electron

      - balenaCloud, Docker

      - Google Cloud
