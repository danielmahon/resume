description: The HydroChemPSC Technology Trailer is an interactive mobile
  exhibit, that travels the country and showcases the company's latest services
  and technology through remotely updated touchscreen and physical interfaces.
challenge: >-
  The client was struggling to showcase their continually evolving service-lines
  and state-of-the-art technology to a broad customer base throughout the United
  States. Traditional marketing materials only told part of the story and
  typical trade show exhibits were not mobile. They needed a solution that would
  work throughout the year, where and when they needed it.


  The content needed to be easily updated so that they could keep their brand and message ahead of the competition. The ultimate goal was to inform, educate, and impress upon prospective customers the value of their services and industry leading technology.
solution: The solution was to design and build a mobile trade-show exhibit that
  allowed HydroChemPSC to bring it with them to customer locations and marketing
  events. This "Technology Trailer" would provide a unique interactive
  experience to the typical "sales pitch" and allow prospective customers to not
  only learn about their latest service offerings, but also to demo some of that
  technology in physical and virtual form.

challenges:
  - label: Create an engaging environment
    content: >-
      Turning a "boring" old semi-trailer interior into a futuristic themed
      environment was no easy task. We enlisted the help of a local trade-show
      exhibit company and worked with them to strip the old trailer and build
      the core structure for the new one. Once the guts were in, it was time to
      add the artwork and interactivity. Eight "stations" lined the walls and
      panels of the architecture allowing for a group of customers and a sales
      team to focus on individual topics and travel through the trailer similar
      to exhibits at a science museum. Various technologies were employed at
      each station to encourage interaction.


      Some technologies used:


      - 10", 29", 50" multi-touch displays
        - Intel NUC Linux systems running dockerized os
        - Multi-screen capability
        - Custom react-native applications
      - Motion sensor-driven content

      - Realtime virtual simulations built with the Unity game engine
        - User input via custom industrial controls running on Arduino
      - Arduino controlled interactive lighting

      - Large scale back-lit capacitive "buttons" that can control display applications

      - Spacial audio controllers with hidden speakers

      - Demo versions of industrial tooling built on RaspberryPi/Arduino(s)

      - Much more...
  - label: Make content easy to update remotely
    content: >-
      Each interactive display application is connected to the internet via
      cellular modem and can be remotely updated by authorized users, via a
      web-based content management system built on ReactJS and NodeJS, running
      on Google Cloud. Changes are instant if the trailer has a good cellular
      connection. Offline updates are pulled down automatically after reconnect.
      All display applications are cached offline and work without an internet
      connection. System os and applications can also be remotely flashed and
      monitored via balenaCloud. 


      Some technologies used:


      - ReactJS, React-Native, Electron

      - balenaCloud, Docker

      - Google Cloud
  - label: Showcase tangible tool functionality and value
    content: >-
      The core services showcased in this project typically involved
      high-voltage systems, industrial pneumatics, and high-pressure water
      blasting, most of which are inappropriate for this environment. Simplified
      "demo" tools were constructed that mimicked key functionality while
      remaining tangible. Virtual demos built on game engine technology allowed
      for additional interactive experiences.


      Some technologies used:


      - RaspberryPi, Arduino

      - 3D printing, CNC machining

      - Custom circuitry and electronics

      - Unity game engine
  - label: Leave the customer "impressed" and educated
    content: Part of the challenge was to make sure a prospective customer enjoyed
      the experience and walked away educated about relevant service offerings
      and excited about future business opportunities. Service contracts can be
      worth millions of dollars, so ensuring the client stands-out against the
      competition is essential for the sales team. This project is solely unique
      in the industry and has directly resulted in increased sales since its
      launch.
